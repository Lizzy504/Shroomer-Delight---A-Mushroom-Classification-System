# Shroomer-Delight - A Mushroom Classification System 
Data Curation Project- A repository on about a hypothetical data set entitled "Mushroom Classification: Safe to Eat or Deadly Poison"

This repository consists of several files:

Data File - Contains a dataset about mushrooms entitled “Mushroom Classification Safe to Eat or Deadly Poison". This data set not only benefits the scientific community, but it is a useful data set in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms for the average “shrooming” individual.The Mushroom Classification data set contains hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms.

Attribute Information File  -  Descripton of attributes helps to understand code in the data file. For example   cap-shape: bell=b,conical=c,convex=x,flat=f, knobbed=k,sunken=s
 cap-surface: fibrous=f,grooves=g,scaly=y,smooth=s
